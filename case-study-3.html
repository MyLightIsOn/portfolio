                <p>
                  Learning accessible design and development wasn't
                  intentionally, but it also wasn't an accident. I like to think
                  UX should be approached like a craft and therefore all aspects
                  of it interest me. My often repeated mantra is "Accessibility
                  is a user experience" so naturally I picked up these skills
                  along the way.
                </p>
                <br />

                <br />

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  Accessibilty in software development is overlooked far too
                  often for a variety of reasons. It's seen as doing "extra"
                  while returning little. Not only that, but accessibility is
                  usually introduced in its entirety, making it very
                  overwhelming for product teams to pick up while also managing
                  their daily tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In several of my previous roles, I have been tasked with
                  teaching product teams (and executives) what accessibility is,
                  how to comfotably include it in the product life cycle, and
                  how to anaylze our products through the lends of
                  accessibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This case study is an overview of how I go about this task.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Foundation:</h4>

                <p>
                  It helps to start with explaining why accessibility is
                  important. Most people have a vague idea that it is, but it is
                  impactful to give statistical data that outlines
                  accessibility's impact. I won't go into all of them here, but
                  I will point out a few major reaons that software companies
                  should focus more on a11y.

                    ignores a population the size of China is certainly not good
                    business.

                <h4>Accessibility Heuristics:</h4>

                <p>
                  As I mentioned before, often times accessibilty is introduced
                  to product teams in its entirety. Usually this is done with
                  reference to the WCAG, which is a fairly comprehensive set of
                  guidelines that consist of 78 Success Criteria. Many of this
                  criteria is subjective and very detailed, making it quite
                  intimidating for teams to pick up. To make it easier for those
                  wanting to learn, I created a set of 6 Core Accessibility
                  Heuristics.
                </p>

                <figure>
                  <img
                    class="case-study-image"
                    src="assets/img/blog/details/case_study_3/core_a11y.webp"
                    alt="Core Accessibility Heuristics: Keyboard Interaction, Screen Reader Support, Page Structure, Readability, Meaningful Content, and User Quality of Life"
                  />
                  <figcaption class="case-study-caption">
                    Core Accessibility Heuristics: Keyboard Interaction, Screen
                    Reader Support, Page Structure, Readability, Meaningful
                    Content, and User Quality of Life
                  </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                  These heuristics allow teams to more easily understand what
                  the expectation is from a user's perspective. This simplifies
                  they way accessiblity is included in product requirements. The
                  summarly of each heuristic is as follows:
                </p>

                <table class="detail-table">
                  <tr>
                    <th>Heuristic</th>
                    <th>Details</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Keyboard Interaction</td>
                    <td>
                      Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible and
                      operable via keyboard.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Meaningful Content</td>
                    <td>
                      Ensure important information are clearly described in
                      text.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Page Structure</td>
                    <td>
                      Ensure that the structure and functionality of the page

                <p>
                  These heuristics are based on the 10 heuristics recommened by
                  <a
                    href="https://accessibility.deque.com/accessibility-heuristics/"

                </p>

                <p>
                  I felt that 10 was a bit much so I reorganzied them into 6.
                  Each heuristic matches to a WCAG specificaiton. This system of
                  heuristics is entirely customizable based on the organizations
                  needs. As you can see in the
                  <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18RVLVmDTW-BJkURQth18eiwM-y0tmy4CvFtYGqJU9Rc/edit?usp=drive_link"

                    >spreadsheet breakdown (See heuristics sheet)</a
                  >, I have prioritized them based on the needs of my last job.
                  I also highlighted which role was primarily repsonsible for
                  it, but these are all subjective and overlapping. It's more of
                  a guide than a strict set of rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                  All of these questions in each heuristic are not meant to be
                  used at once. They can be slowly introducd overtime based on
                  the needs of the user and the capacity of the product team.

                <h4>Practical Application:</h4>

                <p>
                  To demonstrate how these heuristics can be used to quickly
                  evaluate a user expeirence, I have provided an analysis of a
                  website of a trade show I attended while doing research for
                  the
                  <a
                    href="http://localhost:63342/portfolio/case-study-1.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    >ABC Jewelry Case Study</a
                  >.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First, there's two types of accessibility analysis that I do.
                  One is a quick heuristic analysis, which I will do now. The
                  other is a full audit, which would require an automated test
                  and a manual test. The latter being much more thorough, but
                  takes a lot more time. It also requies more technical
                  expertise, which is why I recommend teams do a heuristic
                  analysis while leaving the manual testing to a dedicated
                  tester.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In a heuristic analysis, all one has to do is answer each
                  question about the UI. It's really that simple. For this
                  example, we'll take a look at the
                  <a href="https://www.jckonline.com/">JCK Jewelry Show</a>
                  website. Let's check it's Keyboard Interaction heuristics.

                      chaotic. It doesn't help that you can't see the focus at

                  As you can see from the results, the homepage is a nightmare
                  for keyboard users. I find that Uis that fail keyboard
                  interaction heuristics, typically do bad on all the rest. Feel
                  free to go to the link above and operate it with a keyboard to
                  see what that experience is like.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Because the heuristics map to a WCAG spec, it makes it very
                  easy to complete an

                <h4>Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  Designers find it easier to learn accessiblity through this
                  method. I usually structure my figma files to reflect the
                  heuristics. When PMs, engineers, and designers all approach
                  accessiblity heuristically, anyone can easily look at an
                  annoated Figma file and figure out what's going on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here I am annotating screenshots of the US to show how this
                  looks in practice. I'm using the
                  <a

                  I am working on building an online guide to make this
                  information available to the public. Using this system, I
                  strongly believe that any team can adopt good, efficient,
                  accessibility practices if given the time and space to do so.
