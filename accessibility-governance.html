                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                  Learning accessible design and development wasn't intentional,
                  but it also wasn't an accident. I like to think UX should be
                  approached like a craft, and therefore all aspects of it
                  interest me. My often repeated mantra is, "Accessibility is a
                  User Experience," so naturally, I picked up these skills along
                  the way since I consider all user experience topics within my
                  purview.
                </p>
                <br />

                <br />

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  Accessibility in software development is overlooked far too
                  often for a variety of reasons. It's seen as doing "extra"
                  while returning little. Not only that, but accessibility is
                  usually introduced in its entirety, making it very
                  overwhelming for product teams to pick up while also managing
                  their daily tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In several of my previous roles, I have been tasked with
                  teaching product teams (and executives) what accessibility is,
                  how to comfortably include it in the product life cycle, and
                  how to analyze our products through the lens of accessibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This case study is an overview of how I break down
                  accessibility in a way that makes the topic easier to
                  understand.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Foundation:</h4>

                <p>
                  It's beneficial to begin by explaining why accessibility is
                  important. While most people have a general sense that it
                  matters, providing statistical data that highlights its true
                  impact can be more persuasive. I won't cover all the data
                  here, but I will highlight a few key reasons why software
                  companies should prioritize accessibility.

                <h4>Accessibility Heuristics:</h4>

                <p>
                  As I mentioned before, accessibility is often introduced to
                  product teams in its entirety, typically referencing the
                  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" target="_blank"
                    >WCAG</a
                  >, a comprehensive set of guidelines with 78 Success Criteria.
                  Much of this criteria is subjective and detailed, making it
                  quite intimidating for teams to grasp. To simplify the
                  learning process, I created a set of 6 Core Accessibility
                  Heuristics.
                </p>

                <a
                  class="venobox"

                    <img

                      alt="Core Accessibility Heuristics: Keyboard Interaction, Screen Reader Support, Page Structure, Readability, Meaningful Content, and User Quality of Life"

                <br /><br />
                <p>
                  These heuristics allow teams to more easily understand what
                  the expectation is from a user's perspective. This simplifies
                  they way accessibility is included in product requirements.
                  The summary of each heuristic is as follows:
                </p>

                <table class="detail-table">
                  <tr>

                  <tr>

                <p>
                  These heuristics are based on the 10 heuristics recommened by
                  <a
                    href="https://accessibility.deque.com/accessibility-heuristics/"

                  >
                </p>

                <p>
                  I felt that 10 was a bit much, so I reorganized them into 6.
                  Each heuristic corresponds to a specific WCAG specification.
                  This system of heuristics is entirely customizable based on
                  the organization's needs. As you can see in the
                  <a
                    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18RVLVmDTW-BJkURQth18eiwM-y0tmy4CvFtYGqJU9Rc/edit?usp=drive_link"

                    >Spreadsheet Breakdown (see Heuristics Sheet)</a
                  >, I have prioritized them based on the needs of my last job.
                  I also highlighted which role was primarily responsible for
                  each heuristic, though these are subjective and often
                  overlapping. It's more of a guide than a strict set of rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The questions within each heuristic are not meant to be used
                  all at once. They can be gradually introduced over time, based
                  on the needs of the user and the capacity of the product team.

                <h4>Practical Application:</h4>

                <p>
                  To demonstrate how these heuristics can be used to quickly
                  evaluate a user experience, I have provided an analysis of a
                  website for a trade show I attended while conducting research
                  for the
                  <a
                    href="http://localhost:63342/portfolio/case-study-1.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Envvia Jewelry Retail App Case Study</a
                  >.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There are two types of accessibility analyses that I perform.
                  One is a quick heuristic analysis, which I will demonstrate
                  now. The other is a full audit, which involves both automated
                  and manual testing. The latter is much more thorough but also
                  takes significantly more time and requires more technical
                  expertise. Therefore, I recommend teams conduct a heuristic
                  analysis and leave the manual testing to a dedicated tester.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In a heuristic analysis, one simply answers each question
                  about the UI. It's really that simple. For this example, we'll
                  examine the JCK Jewelry Show website. Let's check its Keyboard
                  Interaction heuristics.

                  As you can see from the results, the homepage is a nightmare
                  for keyboard users. I find that UIs that fail keyboard
                  interaction heuristics typically perform poorly on all other
                  heuristics as well. Feel free to visit the link above and try
                  navigating the site with a keyboard to experience it for
                  yourself.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Because the heuristics map to a WCAG spec, it makes it very
                  easy to complete an

                <h4>Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  Designers find it easier to learn accessibility through this
                  method. I usually structure my Figma files to reflect the
                  heuristics when designing for accessibility. When PMs,
                  engineers, and designers all approach accessibility the same
                  way heuristically, anyone can easily look at an annotated
                  Figma file and understand what's going on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here I am annotating screenshots of the UI to show how this
                  looks in practice. I'm using the
                  <a

                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

                <p>
                  I am working on building an online guide to make this
                  information available to the public. Using this system, I
                  strongly believe that any team can adopt good, efficient,
                  accessibility practices if given the time and space to do so.
