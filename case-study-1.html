                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>
                  I own a jewelery software consulting firm that I use to take
                  on new and interesting projects when I am in-between jobs. I
                  currently have about 10 contractors that I work with off and
                  on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was contract work for an upcoming jewelry consulting
                  company
                  <a href="https://envvia.com/" target="_blank">Envvia</a>. The
                  core mission of this company is to partner with small to
                  midsize jewelry brands/designers in Asia to promote and sell
                  their products for commission in the US.
                </p>
                <br />

                <br />

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  Envvia is composed of approximately 20 jewelry sales
                  consultants. These consultants are very experienced, with many
                  years in retail. They also have a long list of high-value
                  clients with whom they have developed relationships over the
                  years.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Envvia also has two administrators who source jewelry and
                  precious stones for the consultants to present to their
                  clients.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The problem they were facing was one of scale. Most
                  communication was done through email, texts, WhatsApp, and
                  WeChat. This communication style worked fine when they were
                  small, but as they grew, it became overwhelming quite fast.
                </p>

                <p>
                  They reached out to us to build an admin portal that would
                  help them manage their inventory, share products with
                  consultants, and streamline their workflows.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                  "Basically we augment our jewelry partner's sales teams. To do
                  that, we need to manage the products of many brands. We need
                  to find things fast. We need to stay organized.‚Äù <br />
                  <span>Sophia - Founding Partner</span>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  To manage this global sales team, Envvia needed a product
                  inventory solution that allows their consultants to quickly
                  find jewelry based on the specific tastes of their clients. A
                  bonus goal was that this solution would also help consultants
                  conduct personalized outreach.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Team Building:</h4>

                <p>
                  At this time, my usual go-to designers were busy with other
                  project work, so I had to build a whole new team.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One major factor in this project was that the company is based
                  in Hong Kong and worked with jewelry companies there but sells
                  mainly to the US. These US customers were often Chinese
                  Americans or immigrants from China. This meant that I‚Äôd have
                  to hire someone who really understands the buying habits of
                  Chinese luxury consumers as well as the behaviors of
                  non-Chinese consumers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The candidate I eventually settled on had a good deal of
                  experience leading small teams, as well as a strong background
                  in user research. Research was important because Envvia‚Äôs
                  approach was unique and aimed to be disruptive in the jewelry
                  industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We would hire the other three designers later, after the
                  discovery phase. For now, my new hire and I needed to develop
                  a research strategy to learn more about this particular use
                  case.
                </p>

                <h4>Discovery:</h4>

                <p>
                  The target jewelry designers that ABC Jewels works with are
                  based in Hong Kong, one of the most active cities in the
                  international jewelry trade. We started our research by going
                  to Hong Kong and visiting two of the biggest jewelry shows in
                  Asia;
                  <a
                    href="https://jgw.exhibitions.jewellerynet.com/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >The Jewelry and Gem World Exhiition</a
                  >
                  and
                  <a
                    href="https://www.hktdc.com/event/hkjewellery/en"
                    target="_blank"
                    >The Hong Kong International Jewelry Show</a
                  >.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here we had a chance to talk to many jewelry designers (There
                  were 500+ exhibitors for each show) as well as talk with ABC
                  Jewelry founders about their goals, history, and motivations.
                  From this, we created very representative personas of all
                  participants in this concept.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The two personas I will address in this case-study are the ABC
                  Jewelry Admin and the Jewelry Consultant. The end consumer is
                  also a persona but the scope of this case study will be about
                  the admin side of the application and their interactions with
                  consultants.
                </p>
                <br /><br />

                <p>
                  The Consultant will browse the inventory and share items of
                  interest with their client. They are the front line of ABC
                  Jewelry. Their clients are high touch with high expectations.
                  They often need to find unique, expensive inspirations
                  quickly.

                  The Jewelry Admin's jobs is to be constantly be adding to
                  inventory as well as supporitng consultant's requests. They
                  will have a large network of sources for stones and jewelry.
                  Searching through products efficiently is paramount.

                <h4>Competitive Analysis:</h4>
                <p>
                  Envvia's model is very different from the traditional way
                  jewelry is sold. There is on retail store and much of the
                  initial conversations happen online. We reviewed all the major
                  online only jewelry retail companies to find out what they did
                  well and where they were lacking.
                </p>

                    alt="User research - competitive analysis screenshot"

                  </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                  At this point, we had a good understanding of our users goals,
                  their pain points, and the domain that we‚Äôd be working in. We
                  were confident that we could get started on the architecture.
                </p>
                <br /><br />

                <h4>Information Architecture:</h4>
                <p>
                  To make sure we captured all the required functionality for
                  this project, we created a product requirements document and
                  used that to make the high level information architecture.
                  Throughout this, we met regularly with the stakeholders at ABC
                  Jewelry to ensure we were on the right track.
                </p>

                <figure>
                  <img
                    class="case-study-image"
                    src="assets/img/blog/details/case_study_1/information_architecture.webp"
                    alt="Information architecture screenshot"
                  />
                  <figcaption class="case-study-caption">
                    Screenshot of Information Architecture
                  </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                  The complexity of the project grew, but we knew we would trim
                  the fat by the end. Just as I suspected, this would actually
                  be two apps that communicate with each other via an API. The
                  reason being that the consultant side would also function as
                  an online store for their clients. This meant it could not
                  have the utility style of the admin portion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As we were desigining, the dynamics of ABC's operations were
                  changing due to them being a fast moving startup. Our
                  flexible, agile approach allowed us to keep up. During this
                  phase, we hired 3 (1 in Malaysia, two in India) more designers
                  to do the actual design work. One would be assigned to the
                  consultant side while the other two designed the admin side.
                </p>

                <br /><br />

                <h4>Design:</h4>
                <p>
                  Over the next few weeks, we designed, tested, and iterated
                  repeatedly. We really leaned heavily on prototyping because
                  Envvia was adamant about getting the experience right before
                  we sought out developers. I wholeheartedly agreed with this
                  approach, as it is much more cost-effective than designing as
                  you build.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this point, I had returned to the US, while the designers
                  remained in Asia. This meant many late nights for me, as I
                  scheduled all meetings to be convenient for them.
                  Communication was essential as we were working across several
                  different time zones.

                <h4>Technical Architecture:</h4>
                <p>
                  As Envvia‚Äôs business model continues to adapt, I knew that
                  developing the project would mean we‚Äôd have to pick a tech
                  stack that is easy to set up, quick to change, and capable of
                  scaling.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For this, I chose to use NextJS on the frontend, which is a
                  React-based, server-side framwork. Styling is done with
                  Tailwind CSS. It talks to the backend using a REST API. The
                  backend is built on top of Strapi using a Postgres database.
                  Strapi is a CMS built for quick prototyping, allowing us to
                  tweak product info and user flows without having to hire
                  developers each time.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This cut the development costs by 35% from the original
                  estimate.
                </p>

                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

                <p>
                  As of this writing, development is currently underway on the
                  Admin side. I‚Äôve built a simplified version of the consultant
                  side that doesn‚Äôt have all the features we designed, but it is
                  enough for Envvia to at least conduct business until the
                  development team has completed the admin side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though the project is still ongoing, it‚Äôs been a very
                  successful and is used daily by Envvia.
                </p>
