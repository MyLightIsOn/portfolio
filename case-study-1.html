                  This was contract work for an upcoming jewelry consulting
                  company. Their core mission of this company is to partner with
                  small to midsize jewelry brands/designers to promote and sell
                  their products for commission.
                </p>
                <br />

                <br />

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  From this point on, we’ll refer to the jewelry consulting
                  company as ABC Jewels. ABC Jewels is aiming to disrupt the
                  jewelry industry by partnering directly with small to midsize
                  brands and selling their jewelry around the world. ABC Jewels
                  is composed of many jewelry sales consultants with a number of
                  years of experience. Each consultant also has many loyal
                  clients. This software is to help everyone in this B2B2C
                  relationship.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                  "Basically we augment their sales teams. To do that, we need
                  to manage the products of many brands. We need to find things
                  fast. We need to stay organized.” <br />-
                  <span>Founding Partner</span>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  To manage this global sales team, ABC Jewels needed a product
                  inventory solution that allows their consultants to quickly
                  find jewelry based on specific tastes of their clients. A
                  bonus goal would be that this solution would also help
                  consultants do personalized outreach.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Team Building:</h4>
                <p>
                  As mentioned before, this was contract work, so it was a side
                  project from my day job. Because ABC Jewelry is Hong Kong
                  based, that meant that I woulc be able to work on it in the
                  evenings after my day job. Of course, I am not a machine, so I
                  was going to need help with guiding the design process. I used
                  the initial upfront fee to budget for a UX lead and designers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I put a job posting on Upwork and interviewed a handful of
                  people, but I eventually decided to go with
                  <a href="https://my.linkedin.com/in/chuiyinwong"
                    >Chui Yin Wong</a
                  >. Her experience with UX as well as her understanding of the
                  buying habits of consumers in Asia was invaluble. She led the
                  way in developing our UX approach and guided many of our UX
                  sessions with the client.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Based on my initial discovery, I knew that this project would
                  require a tech stack that allowed for fast prototyping and
                  easy updates to support ABC Jewelry's experimental business
                  models. I won't go into the technical details here, but this
                  helped me narrow down consulting firm company that also had
                  amazing designers, but also a development team that understood
                  the goal for an easier handoff.

                <h4>User Research:</h4>

                <p>
                  The target jewelry designers that ABC Jewels works with are
                  based in Hong Kong, one of the most active cities in the
                  international jewelry trade. I started my research by going to
                  Hong Kong and visiting two of the biggest jewelry shows in
                  Asia;
                  <a
                    href="https://jgw.exhibitions.jewellerynet.com/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >The Jewelry and Gem Hong Kong</a
                  >
                  and
                  <a
                    href="https://www.hktdc.com/event/hkjewellery/en"
                    target="_blank"
                    >The Hong Kong International Jewelry Show</a
                  >.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here I had a chance to talk to many jewelry designers (There
                  were 500+ for each show) as well as talk with ABC Jewels about
                  their goals, history, and motivations. From this, I created
                  very representative personas of all participants in this
                  concept.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The two personas I will address in this case-study are the ABC
                  Jewels Admin and the Jewelry Consultant. There is buyer
                  persona but that applies to the online shop portion of the
                  application. This case study is about the admin side.
                </p>
                <br /><br />

                <h5 class="blog-subsection">Persona #1: Consultant</h5>
                <figure>
                  <img
                    class="case-study-image"
                    src="assets/img/blog/details/case_study_1/persona_1.webp"
                    alt="Jewelry consultant persona"
                  />

                  </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                  The Consultant will browse the inventory and share items of
                  interest with the client. They are the front line of ABC
                  Jewels. Their clients are high touch with high expectations.
                  They often need to find unique, inspirations quickly.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h5 class="blog-subsection">Persona #2: Admin</h5>
                <figure>
                  <img

                  </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                  The Jewelry Admin's jobs is to be constantly be adding to
                  inventory as well as supporitng consultant's requests. They
                  will have a large network of sources for stones and jewelry.
                  Searching through products efficiently is paramount.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h4>Domain Research:</h4>
                <p>
                  At the time, I did not have a lot of exposure to the jewelry
                  industry, especially at these price points ($100K+) so I had
                  my lead designer do a significant amount of domain research to
                  get us up to speed, and we analyzed the findings to create a
                  solid competitor analysis.

                  At this point, we had a good understanding of our users goals,
                  their pain points, and the domain that we’d be working in. We
                  were confident that we could get started on the UI.

                <h4>Information Architecture:</h4>
                <p>
                  To make sure we captured all the required functionality for
                  this project, we created a product requirements document and
                  used that to make the high level information architecture.
                  Throughout this, we met regularly with the stakeholders at ABC
                  Jewelry to ensure we were on the right track.

                  The complexity of the project grew, but we knew we would trim
                  the fat by the end. Just as I suspected, this would actually
                  be two apps that communicate with each other via an REST API.
                  As we were desigining, the dynamics of ABC's operations were
                  changing due to them being a fast moving startup. Our
                  flexible, agile approach allowed us to keep up.

                <h4>Design:</h4>
                <p>
                  After several weeks of late night (At least late for me)
                  design sessions, we finally completed the UI deisgn.

                  Technical architectural decisions I made in this process ended
                  up saving ABC Jewels a lot of money from the original
                  development estimate. We also shipped earlier than expected
                  due to cutting non-essential features and focusing just on
                  what was needed right now.
