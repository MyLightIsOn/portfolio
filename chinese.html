                <p>
                  Language learning apps are a big business. Companies like
                  Duolingo have millions of daily users. Creating languange
                  learning apps also require huge investments in staff and
                  content creation. Content needs to be designed, updated, and
                  refreshed by native language speakers who are at least
                  bilingual. AI has really changed the landscape of that
                  industry lowering the barrier of entry significantly.
                </p>
                <br />

                <br />

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  I've been learning Chinese as a hobby for five years. During
                  that time, I’ve tried many language learning apps. Learning a
                  language requires tackling several different skills at once:
                  vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, reading comprehension, and
                  listening. Some apps are strong in one area, but few manage to
                  cover them all effectively.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Naturally, this comes at a cost. The best apps are paid, and
                  understandably so. It takes significant resources to build
                  high-quality, varied content. But beyond cost, there are
                  deeper issues that often make these tools less effective for
                  long-term learners.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <span class="bold">Most apps are student-focused</span>
                  - They tend to be designed for college-aged learners or
                  students studying abroad, with early lessons centered on
                  topics like school, classes, and dating. For older
                  professionals, this content can feel irrelevant or even
                  off-putting in the early stages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="bold">The content becomes repetitive</span> -
                  Since most app content is pre-written and rarely updated,
                  heavy users like me eventually start memorizing answers rather
                  than truly understanding the material. This undermines
                  meaningful learning and retention.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To get around these limitations, I started experimenting with
                  AI to support my learning. Initially, I used it to quiz me on
                  vocabulary I struggled with. Then I asked it to generate short
                  paragraphs to practice reading comprehension. That evolved
                  into having entire conversations in Chinese. Each step
                  revealed more possibilities for how AI could transform the way
                  I learn.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Competitive Analysis:</h4>

                <p>
                  Since I’ve used so many language learning apps over the years,
                  I had essentially completed a competitive analysis in my head.
                  To formalize it, I revisited the apps I liked most and took
                  note of the features they did well or had in common.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <span class="bold">Gamification</span> - Nearly all language
                  learning apps incorporate some form of gamification. This
                  makes sense, because outside a classroom setting, it’s hard
                  for many people to stay motivated. Gamified elements like
                  points, streaks, and rewards help maintain engagement over
                  time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="bold">Playful Style</span> - In line with
                  gamification, these apps often adopt a visual style similar to
                  mobile games. Bright colors, cute mascots, and satisfying
                  animations are common design choices that make the learning
                  experience feel more fun and approachable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="bold">Guided Learning</span> - These apps are
                  typically aimed at absolute beginners, especially college-aged
                  users. As a result, the learning content is highly structured
                  and simplified, often focused on topics relevant to that
                  demographic—like classes, roommates, or dating.
                </p>

                <h4>AI UX Considerations:</h4>
                <p>
                  AI is advancing at a rapid pace. My experience using AI to
                  support my Chinese studies has revealed both exciting UX
                  opportunities and unique design challenges. While there’s
                  plenty of technical documentation on how to implement AI,
                  there’s still a noticeable lack of guidance when it comes to
                  designing user experiences around it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here are a few key observations I’ve made while using AI in my
                  own language learning:
                </p>

                <table class="detail-table">
                  <tr>
                    <th>Advantages</th>
                    <th>Details</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Customized Content</td>
                    <td>
                      Because AI can generate content on the fly, there’s no
                      need to create a large amount of it and store it in a
                      database. The user can tell the AI what topics they want
                      to use to learn and what areas they want to focus on.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>More Detailed Feedback</td>
                    <td>
                      In learning apps, they generally tell you right or wrong.
                      AI can give you more explanation and provide guidance
                      specific to you. It can answer your questions in ways that
                      pre-generated content never will.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Less Repeated Content</td>
                    <td>
                      AI's can generate new content effortlessly. Users will
                      never find themselves unintenionally memorizing test
                      questions.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
                <br /><br />
                <table class="detail-table">
                  <tr>
                    <th>Disadvantages</th>
                    <th>Details</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Hallucinations</td>
                    <td>
                      Hallucinations occur when the AI is confidently wrong
                      about something. It may make up information if it doesn’t
                      know the answer. This is a BIG problem because if you are
                      learning something, you may not realize that the
                      infomration is incorrect.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Irrelevant content</td>
                    <td>
                      It doesn’t take much for the user's inputs to cause the AI
                      go off-topic. This can be controlled, but requires extra
                      effort and forethought.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </table>

                <h4>Possible Solutions to AI UX Disadvantages:</h4>
                <p>
                  Addessing these disadvantages is a first step, however
                  usability testing on the outputs of AI will be an essential
                  step in ensuring they perform as expected consistently.
                </p>

                <table class="detail-table">
                  <tr>
                    <th>Disadvantages</th>
                    <th>Possible Solution</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Hallucinations</td>
                    <td>
                      To reduce hallucinations, I avoid relying solely on the
                      language model to generate translations. Instead, I use a
                      retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to support its
                      responses with verified data. Fortunately, I discovered
                      CC-CEDICT, an open-source Chinese dictionary with over
                      120,000 entries. While it isn’t as comprehensive as I need
                      for my use case, it provides a solid foundation to build
                      on.

                      Letting users freely enter text prompts can lead to
                      unpredictable or irrelevant AI responses. To keep content
                      focused and useful, it's important to guide both input and
                      output. One solution is to let users select specific
                      topics or themes they want to study. This helps constrain
                      the AI’s generation space. Additionally, using an
                      evaluator agent to review the AI’s output ensures that the
                      generated content aligns with the user’s learning goals
                      and stays on topic.

                <h4>Proof of Concept:</h4>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
                  As mentioned earlier, this application has two major
                  components. In the proof of concept, I chose to develop them
                  simultaneously. Below, I describe each part in more detail.
                </p>
                <br /><br />

                <h4>Part 1: Building The Dictionary</h4>

                <p>
                  The foundation of the application is a comprehensive Chinese
                  dictionary. Users can search for words they want to study and
                  save them to their personal dictionary. From there, they can
                  generate a variety of exercises tailored to their selected
                  vocabulary.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To begin, I used
                  <a href="https://cc-cedict.org/wiki/" target="_blank"
                    >CC-CEDICT</a
                  >, an open-source Chinese dictionary with over 120,000
                  entries. Originally started in 1997, it’s a great resource—but
                  it wasn’t robust enough for my goals.
                </p>

                      class="case-study-image"
                      src="assets/img/case_study_2/cedict_bus_entry.webp"
                      alt="Original CEDICT Dictionary entry for bus"
                    />
                    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">
                      Original CEDICT Dictionary entry for bus

                  </figure>
                </a>

                <p>
                  As shown above, the original entry for “bus” in CEDICT
                  contains only four fields. While sufficient for general use, I
                  envisioned a more scalable platform that could serve many
                  learners with different needs. This meant expanding each
                  dictionary entry with richer information.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For example, categorizing words by HSK level is essential—this
                  is how many learners assess their proficiency and track
                  progress. Monitoring this over time could yield valuable
                  insights into user learning patterns and help shape future
                  product decisions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I spent several days gathering supplemental data—such as HSK
                  levels, character radicals, and phonetic systems like bopomofo
                  (used primarily in Taiwan), alongside pinyin (commonly used by
                  English speakers).
                </p>

                <p>
                  With this additional information, I made significant
                  enhancements to the dictionary database. Here’s what an
                  enriched entry looks like:
                </p>

                  class="venobox"
                  data-gall="gall-img"
                  href="assets/img/case_study_2/updated_entry.webp"
                >
                  <figure>
                    <img
                      class="case-study-image"

                <br /><br />

                <h4>Part 2: Exercise Generation</h4>

                <p>
                  Exercise generation is at the heart of this application. A
                  wide variety of exercise types is essential for reinforcing
                  different aspects of language learning—from vocabulary and
                  grammar to listening and speaking.
                </p>
                <p>Below is a list of the exercise types the app supports:</p>

                <table class="detail-table">

                <h4>User Flow:</h4>

                <p>
                  In the Chinese learning communities I’m part of, there’s been
                  a lot of interest in having an app like this available. With
                  that in mind, I designed a user flow that would work not just
                  for me, but for a broader audience of learners.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the most requested features was a skill level
                  assessment to help users get started. I’ve incorporated that
                  into the app’s onboarding experience.

                <h4>Skills Assessment:</h4>

                <p>
                  As mentioned earlier, mastering a language requires developing
                  multiple skills: vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, reading
                  comprehension, and listening. A feature I’d love to see is the
                  ability to identify which of these areas a learner needs to
                  focus on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For example, my Chinese reading is much stronger than my
                  listening. Having visibility into that imbalance, along with
                  personalized progress tracking for each category, would make
                  learning more targeted and effective.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To explore how this might work, I created a few wireframes
                  showing sample question types that assess each skill area.
                </p>

                <a
                  class="venobox"
                  data-gall="gall-img"
                  href="assets/img/case_study_2/question_type.webp"
                >
                  <figure>
                    <img
                      class="case-study-image"
                      src="assets/img/case_study_2/question_type.webp"
                      alt="Question Type Example Wireframes"
                    />

                  </figure>
                </a>

                <h4>UI Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  Lastly, I quickly put together some UI designs in Figma that
                  visually keeps with the spirit of other language learning
                  apps.
                </p>

                      alt="Example Screenshots of XiongMao"
                    />

                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

                <p>
                  I'm currently doing usability testing with the proof of
                  concept and make sure my prompts are returning the right
                  infomration.
