                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                  Language learning apps are a big business. Companies like
                  Duolingo have millions of daily users. Creating languange
                  learning apps also require huge investments in staff and
                  content creation. Content needs to be designed, updated, and
                  refreshed by native language speakders who are at least
                  bilingual. AI has really changed the landscape of that
                  industry lowering the barrier of entry significantly.
                </p>
                <br />

                <br />

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  I’ve been learning Chinese as a hobby for 5 years. Throughout
                  this time, I’ve used many language learning apps. Learning a
                  language means you have to learn several different aspects at
                  once: vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, reading
                  comprehension, and listening. I found that none of the apps do
                  all of these well, so I use several at once to help me in each
                  of these areas.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Obviously, this is costly because the best apps are paid. They
                  are paid because it takes a lot of resources to build all
                  these varieties of content. Furthermore, there are other
                  glaring problems with these apps that hinder learning.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Most are targeted towards students</span>
                    - Most apps are designed for college aged students or
                    students living abroad. Meaning there is a lot of early
                    content about classes, school, dating, etc. For older
                    working professionals, the early learning phases can be a
                    turn off.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Repetitive content</span> - Since all the
                    content is created upfront, unless it is updated often, a
                    high frequency user like me will eventually memorize many of
                    the answers making it hard to determine if they actually
                    understand the content versus memorized it.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  I initially started using AI to support my learning and get
                  around these shortcomings. At first, I just asked it to quiz
                  me on specific vocabulary I struggled with. Then I would ask
                  it to generate small paragraphs to help with my comprehension.
                  This soon turned into me having entire conversations with it
                  in Chinese. Each step opened my mind more and more to the
                  possibilities of AI in learning.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Competitive Analysis:</h4>

                <p>
                  Since I have used so many apps, the competitive analysis was
                  technically already done in my head. I went back and reviewed
                  the apps I liked best and noted things that they did well or
                  had in common.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Gamification</span> - One thing that
                    almost all language learning apps do is gamify the learning
                    experience. This makes sense because, outside a classroom
                    setting, many people find it difficult to stay motivated to
                    learn a language.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Playful Style</span> - To accompany the
                    gamification of learning, these apps are often designed to
                    look like mobile games. Bright colors, cute characters, and
                    rewarding animation were very common.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Guided Learning</span> - Because these
                    apps are designed to teach college aged users that are also
                    absolute beginners, the content is very simplified and often
                    revolves around topics relevant to that demographic
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>AI UX Considerations:</h4>
                <p>
                  AI is advancing rapidly, outpacing the ability of designers to
                  keep up. My experience using AI to assist with Chinese has
                  highlighted many potential UX benefits and challenges.
                  Although there is ample technical information on using AI,
                  there is a scarcity of resources on designing AI UX.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here are some observations I have made while using AI for my
                  own studies. I’m using ChatGPT 4.0 for this applications so
                  any mention of AI is referring to that AI specifically.
                </p>

                <table class="detail-table">

                    <td>
                      Because AI can generate content on the fly, there’s no
                      need to create a large amount of it and store it in a
                      database. The user can tell the AI what topics they want
                      to use to learn and what areas they want to focus on.

                      In learning apps, they generally tell you right or wrong.
                      AI can give you more explanation and provide guidance
                      specific to you. It can answer your questions in ways that
                      pre-generated content never will.

                      know the answer. This is a BIG problem because if you are

                  Addessing these disadvantages is a first step, however
                  usability testing on the outputs of AI will be an essential
                  step in ensuring they perform as expected consistently.

                      Using the OpenAI Assistant API may solve this. It is
                      essentially a ChatGPT that you can train on specific
                      information, It will only reference that information. By
                      giving the AI content that has been previewed,
                      hallucinations could be avoided.

                      Giving the user free rein on text inputs to your AI can be
                      a problem. Of course, you can train your AI to only
                      respond to certain types inputs, but users are clever. If
                      holes exist, they will find them. One possible way to
                      solve this is having the AI generate possible answers only
                      giving the user those options to select from.

                      If ChatGPT is down, the user would not be able to do their

                      content will be generated at specific intervales (daily,
                      weekly, etc.) and that infomration is stored on a database

                <h4>Proof of Concept:</h4>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
                  I put together a proof of concept to test these concepts. I am
                  using the

                  >
                  API. The advantage it has over public ChatGPT is described in
                  the FAQ:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                  “The Assistants API enables developers to easily build
                  powerful AI assistants within their apps. This API removes the
                  need to manage conversation history and adds access to
                  OpenAI-hosted tools like Code Interpreter and File Search. The
                  API also supports improved function calling for 3rd party
                  tools.”
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  This means I would be able to better control what it remembers
                  and outputs. I started by uploading the HSK 3.0 vocabulary and
                  grammar. HSK is the standardized Chinese proficiency test, and
                  I instructed the Assistant to only use these documents to
                  respond. I noticed that the last file failed. It's a pretty
                  large file compared to the others. Breaking down files is
                  probably best, but also I was on airport Wi-Fi so that could
                  be the problem too.

                <p>
                  Next, I built a React frontend that uses REST to communicate
                  with the AI. You can see in the image that each POST request
                  is simply sending predefined messages. This allows me to
                  control the conversation and ensure it stays on topic.

                  are variables updated with React hooks on each button press.

                  Keep in mind that I have not done any design or development to
                  improve the experience, so it's kind of rough looking.
                  However, it accomplishes the technical discovery goal (Hey, I
                  got it working!) and will allow me to do usability testing.

                <h4>User Flow:</h4>

                <p>
                  In the Chinese learning communities that I am in, there was a
                  lot of interest in having an app like this available, so I
                  designed a user flow that would work for users other than
                  myself.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Creating a skill level assessment to get started was a highly
                  requested feature, so I have accounted for that in my design.

                <h4>Skills Assessment:</h4>

                <p>
                  As mentioned above, masterig a langauge involves several
                  different types of learning; Vocabulary, Grammar,
                  Pronunciation, and Reading Comprehension, and Listening. One
                  feature that I would like to see the ability to know which
                  areas you need to work on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My Chinese reading is much better than my listening and being
                  able to show progress and tailor my learning in these
                  categories individually would be extremely helpful.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I created some wireframes to show a few different type samples
                  questions to show how to assess these different areas of
                  learning.

                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

                <p>
                  I'm currently doing usability testing with the proof of
                  concept and training the AI to generate questions and answers
                  without disrupting the experience. One thing I noticed is that
                  the AI will cite the documents it uses. These can be removed
                  with a regex, but it's an interesting observation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Also, sometimes it gives the answer with the question. These
                  reasons are why thorough user testing is an absolute MUST with
                  AI because it feels it's being helpful, but we need to be more
                  instructive.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Just 5 years ago, it would take millions in investment and an
                  army of content creators to build a langauge app like this,
                  however with advances in AI, the logistics barrier has been
                  completely removed. Now it's all about creating the best
                  learning experience.
