                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>
                  This is a project I have been wanting to make for myself for a
                  long time. As a UX engineer in previous roles, logging
                  accessibility issues is a pain. I wanted to make a tool that
                  would help me log accessibility issues and then have a system
                  that would automatically generate a report for me.
                </p>

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  Logging accessibility issues is usually a manual process.
                  There are many tools that can help, but they are not always
                  easy to use. Spreadsheets, the most common tool, but they are
                  tedious, especially when you have a lot of issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Furthermore, non-technical people don't often know what to
                  make of the long lists and details, so further explanation is
                  required.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here is a discussion on Reddit that talks more about these
                  issues:

                  >
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                  " I’m just looking to see what was the best way to present
                  them (a11y issues). I have been using Excel so far but I’m
                  searching for something a little bit more polished. " <br />

                <h4>Agentic System Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  At my current role, I have been using a makeshift system of AI
                  to log issues and generate reports. I was doing this manually
                  just using a few different instances in ChatGPT. It occured to
                  me that others might want to use this as well so I began to
                  workout the experience of how that would be in a unified UI.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Based on how I was using AIs already, I decided to go with a
                  agentic system similar to the
                  <a
                    href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Parallelization</a
                  >
                  workflow coined by Anthropic.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I chose a candidate with strong leadership skills and a solid
                  background in user research, essential for supporting the
                  company’s unique and disruptive approach to the jewelry
                  industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We planned to bring on three more designers after the
                  discovery phase. For now, our focus was on developing a
                  research strategy tailored to this specific use case.
                </p>

                <a
                  class="venobox"
                  data-gall="gall-img"
                  href="assets/img/a11y-bug-logger/parallelization.webp"
                >
                  <figure>
                    <img
                      class="case-study-image"
                      src="assets/img/a11y-bug-logger/parallelization.webp"
                      alt="Parallelization"
                    />
                    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">
                      Parallelization diagram (Source: Anthropic)
                    </figcaption>
                  </figure>
                </a>

                <p>In my case, there will be 4 Agents:</p>

                <ul class="blog-list">
                  <li>
                    <b>LLM 1</b> - for taking users issue descriptions and
                    providing more detail, suggesting fixes, and assigning
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" target="_blank"
                      >WCAG standards</a
                    >.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>LLM 2</b> - will be used to generate reports. This will
                    include a summary of the issues, a list of fixes, and a
                    detailed report.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>LLM 3</b> - will summarize the impact on disabled users.
                    This would be extremely helpful to designers to help them
                    learn user experience as it applies to people with
                    disabilities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>LLM 4</b> - would be the final LLM (The Aggregator) that
                    would create VPATs from all of this information. VPATs are
                    extrememlly expensive (can be $10000+) and time consuming,
                    often taking weeks to months to complete. This would cut
                    down the time and money spent on VPATs considerably.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <br /><br />

                <h4>Object Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  The object structure of this application would all users to
                  categorize issues at a few levels.
                </p>

                <ul class="blog-list">
                  <li>
                    <b>Issues</b> - This is the base element that everything is
                    built on top of. Users create issues logging individual
                    accessibiity problems.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Assessments</b> - Assessments are used to group issues
                    together. For example, if you have a large website, you may
                    want to break it down in parts like signup or transactions.
                    Reports can be generated from this level.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Projects</b> - Projects are used to group assessments.
                    You might have many assessments for one Project. Reports can
                    be generated at this level as well.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <a
                  class="venobox"
                  data-gall="gall-img"

                  </figure>
                </a>

                <br /><br />

                <h4>UI Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  The UI for this application has to be very, very simple. Think
                  JIRA, but even more stripped down. The idea being that anyone
                  (Technical and non-technical) should be able to use this to
                  log issues they find.
                </p>

                  When creating the hifidelty designs, it was important to make
                  sure that the UI was itself, accessible. Large bold fonts,
                  very clear focus/hover states, and high contrast colors were
                  all used to ensure that the UI was accessible to users with
                  visual disablities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Special attention was also paid to keyboard interactivity. As
                  mentioned before, logging issues can be tedious so every extra
                  comfort that could be given to the users was consider in this
                  design.

                <h4>Technical:</h4>

                <p>
                  The stack I went with was NextJS, TailwindCSS for the frontend
                  and FastAPI and PostgreSQL for the backend. The NextJS server
                  would uses GraphQL to communicate with the backend.
                </p>

                <a
                  href="assets/img/a11y-bug-logger/logger-architecture.webp"
                  class="venobox"
                  data-gall="gall-img"
                >
                  <figure>
                    <img
                      class="case-study-image"
                      src="assets/img/a11y-bug-logger/logger-architecture.webp"
                      alt="A11y Logger Architecture"
                    />
                    <figcaption class="case-study-caption">
                      A11y Logger Architecture (View Full Image)
                    </figcaption>
                  </figure>
                </a>

                <p>
                  The Issue Enrichment LLM would be done using NextJS as there
                  is not much computation needed and there's no need to send
                  information through the whole pipeline. Also, issue images
                  would be stored in Cloudinary with the URLs for those images
                  being stored in the database. This would all be handled by
                  NextJS.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The remaining Agents would be used via a FastAPI server since
                  these will be happening asychronosly behind the scenes and
                  require much more computation. When the user views the
                  reports/summaries for assessments, the infomration would have
                  already been enriched and ready for them to read.
                </p>

                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

                <p>
                  The first part of this application is built. Users can log in
                  and log issues using the Issue Enrichent AI. I plan to put up
                  a live demo with credentials soon. User testing is next before
                  I continue because ensuring that logging fast, efficient, and
                  accurate is the core of this application.
