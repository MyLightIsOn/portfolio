                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>
                  As a UX engineer, I often found the process of logging
                  accessibility issues to be time-consuming and inefficient.
                  I’ve long wanted to create a tool that would streamline this
                  workflow and simplify issue reporting and automatically
                  generate clear, useful reports.
                </p>

                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>
                  Accessibility issues are typically logged manually, often
                  using spreadsheets. While tools exist to assist, many are
                  unintuitive or cumbersome, especially when dealing with large
                  volumes of issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, accessibility reports can be overwhelming for
                  non-technical stakeholders. They often require extra
                  explanation to be actionable, which creates communication
                  friction and slows down remediation.
                </p>

                <h4>Agentic System Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  In my current role, I had been using a makeshift system
                  powered by AI to log issues and generate reports. Initially,
                  this was done manually using multiple ChatGPT sessions. As I
                  refined this workflow, it became clear that others could
                  benefit from a more unified experience, so I began designing
                  an integrated UI around it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Drawing from my own usage patterns, I adopted an agent-based
                  architecture inspired by
                  <a
                    href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents"

                    >Anthropic's Parallelization workflow</a

                <p>
                  My system is built around four AI agents, each with a specific
                  role:
                </p>
                <ul class="blog-list">
                  <li>
                    <b>LLM 1</b> – Enhances user-submitted issue descriptions by
                    adding detail, suggesting code-level fixes, and mapping
                    issues to relevant
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" target="_blank"
                      >WCAG standards</a
                    >.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>LLM 2</b> – Generates comprehensive reports, including
                    issue summaries, recommended fixes, and formatted
                    documentation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>LLM 3</b> – Assesses the impact of issues on users with
                    disabilities, providing valuable insights for designers to
                    improve inclusive UX.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>LLM 4</b> – Acts as the Aggregator, compiling outputs
                    from the other agents to generate VPATs. These documents are
                    typically expensive and time-consuming to produce. This
                    system drastically reduces both cost and turnaround time.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <br /><br />

                <h4>Model Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  The application's data model enables users to categorize and
                  manage accessibility issues across multiple levels of context.
                </p>
                <ul class="blog-list">
                  <li>
                    <b>Issues</b> – The foundational element of the system.
                    Users log individual accessibility problems, which serve as
                    the core data for reports and analysis.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Assessments</b> – Assessments group related issues
                    together. For instance, a large website might have separate
                    assessments for different flows like signup or checkout.
                    Reports can be generated at this level.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Projects</b> – Projects serve as containers for multiple
                    assessments. This makes it easier to track accessibility
                    efforts across an entire product or client. Reports can also
                    be generated at the project level.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>UI Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  The user interface for this application was designed to be as
                  simple and intuitive as possible. Think of it as a highly
                  stripped-down version of JIRA that can be used effortlessly by
                  both technical and non-technical users to log accessibility
                  issues.

                <p>
                  During the high-fidelity design phase, accessibility of the UI
                  itself was a top priority. Large, bold fonts, clear focus and
                  hover states, and high-contrast color palettes were employed
                  to ensure usability for individuals with visual impairments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keyboard navigation was also a key focus. Logging issues can
                  be tedious, so every possible comfort and efficiency
                  improvement was considered to make the experience more fluid
                  and accessible.
                </p>

                <h4>Technical:</h4>

                <p>
                  The technology stack includes Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the
                  frontend, with FastAPI and PostgreSQL powering the backend.
                  The frontend communicates with the backend via GraphQL.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The initial issue enrichment, handled by an LLM, is
                  implemented within the Next.js application. This task is
                  relatively lightweight and doesn't require routing through the
                  entire backend pipeline. Additionally, issue images are stored
                  on Cloudinary, with image URLs saved to the database, all
                  managed directly from the frontend.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The remaining AI agents operate on the FastAPI server, running
                  asynchronously in the background. These processes are more
                  resource-intensive and prepare enriched content ahead of time.
                  By the time users access reports or summaries, the data has
                  already been processed and is ready to review.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

                <p>
                  The core functionality of the application is live. Users can
                  sign in and log issues using the AI-powered enrichment system.
                  A public demo with credentials will be available soon. The
                  next focus is user testing to ensure the issue-logging
                  experience is fast, efficient, and accurate as it is the
                  foundation of this tool.
