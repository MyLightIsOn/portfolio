              <div class="blog-text plr-50 mb-70">
                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>
                  This was contract work for an emerging jewelry consulting
                  company. Their mission is to support small to midsize jewelry
                  brands in Asia by promoting and selling their products in the
                  US on commission.
                </p>

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  The team included about 20 experienced jewelry sales
                  consultants, many with long-standing client relationships. Two
                  administrators were responsible for sourcing jewelry and
                  gemstones for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As the company grew, communication via email, text, WhatsApp,
                  and WeChat became difficult to manage.
                </p>

                <p>
                  They needed an admin portal to manage inventory, share
                  products with consultants, and streamline workflows.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                  "Basically we augment our jewelry partner's sales teams. To do
                  that, we need to manage the products of many brands. We need
                  to find things fast. We need to stay organized.” <br />
                  <span>Sophia - Founding Partner</span>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                  To support their global sales team, they required a product
                  inventory system that made it easy for consultants to find
                  jewelry based on client preferences. Ideally, the platform
                  would also assist consultants in conducting personalized
                  pitches.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Team Building:</h4>

                <p>
                  My usual design collaborators were unavailable, so I needed to
                  assemble a new team from scratch.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A key consideration was the company's cross-cultural focus,
                  based in Hong Kong, working with local jewelry brands, and
                  selling primarily to a U.S. market of Chinese Americans and
                  immigrants. I needed someone who deeply understood both
                  Chinese luxury buying habits and broader U.S. consumer
                  behavior.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I chose a candidate with strong leadership skills and a solid
                  background in user research, essential for supporting the
                  company’s unique and disruptive approach to the jewelry
                  industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We planned to bring on three more designers after the
                  discovery phase. For now, our focus was on developing a
                  research strategy tailored to this specific use case.
                </p>

                  </figure>
                </a>

                <h4>Discovery:</h4>

                <p>
                  The target designers were based in Hong Kong, one of the
                  world’s busiest jewelry trade hubs. We began our research on
                  the ground, attending two major trade shows:
                  <a
                    href="https://jgw.exhibitions.jewellerynet.com/"
                    target="_blank"
                    >The Jewelry and Gem World Exhibition</a
                  >
                  and
                  <a
                    href="https://www.hktdc.com/event/hkjewellery/en"
                    target="_blank"
                    >The Hong Kong International Jewelry Show</a
                  >.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With over 500 exhibitors at each event, we spoke to numerous
                  designers and held in-depth discussions with the company's
                  founders about their goals, history, and motivations. This
                  helped us develop detailed, representative personas for
                  everyone involved.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For this case study, I’ll focus on two key personas: the Admin
                  and the Jewelry Consultant. While the end consumer is also
                  important, this project centered on the admin experience and
                  their collaboration with consultants.
                </p>

                <br /><br />

                </a>

                <p>
                  The Consultant browses the inventory and shares select pieces
                  with clients. As the face of the company, they work closely
                  with high-touch clients who expect personalized service and
                  quick access to unique, high-value pieces.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h5 class="blog-subsection">Persona #2: Admin</h5>

                </a>

                <p>
                  The Admin is responsible for continuously adding new items to
                  the inventory and supporting consultant requests. They rely on
                  a wide network of jewelry and stone suppliers. Efficient
                  product search and organization is critical to their role.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h4>Competitive Analysis:</h4>

                <p>
                  This company’s model breaks from tradition. There is no retail
                  storefront and most client interactions happen online. To
                  better understand the landscape, we reviewed major online-only
                  jewelry retailers to assess their strengths and identify gaps.
                </p>

                <a
                  class="venobox"

                </a>

                <p>
                  By this stage, we had a solid grasp of user goals, pain
                  points, and the domain. We were ready to begin defining the
                  product architecture.
                </p>

                <br /><br />

                <h4>Information Architecture:</h4>

                <p>
                  We started by creating a product requirements document to
                  define core functionality, which informed the high-level
                  information architecture. Throughout the process, we met
                  regularly with stakeholders to ensure alignment.

                <p>
                  As the scope evolved, it became clear we were designing two
                  distinct apps connected via API: a utility-focused admin
                  portal and a polished, client-facing storefront for
                  consultants.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With the company rapidly evolving, our agile process helped us
                  stay adaptable. During this phase, we expanded the team by
                  hiring three additional designers, one in Malaysia and two in
                  India. One focused on the consultant-facing side, while the
                  other two worked on the admin interface.
                </p>

                <br /><br />

                <h4>Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  Over several weeks, we designed, tested, and iterated
                  extensively. Prototyping played a central role, as the team
                  prioritized perfecting the user experience before involving
                  developers; A strategy I fully supported for its
                  cost-effectiveness and clarity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By this stage, I had returned to the U.S. while the design
                  team remained in Asia. To support them, I scheduled meetings
                  around their time zones, often working late into the night.
                  Clear, consistent communication was critical to keeping us
                  aligned across continents.
                </p>

                <h4>Technical Architecture:</h4>

                <p>
                  With the company’s business model still evolving, we needed a
                  tech stack that was easy to set up, flexible, and scalable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We chose Next.js for the frontend (a React-based framework
                  with server-side rendering) paired with Tailwind CSS for
                  styling. The frontend communicates with a REST API. The
                  backend is powered by Strapi and a PostgreSQL database.
                  Strapi’s CMS features allowed us to quickly iterate on product
                  data and user flows without constant developer input.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This approach reduced development costs by 20% compared to
                  initial estimates.
                </p>

                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

                <p>
                  Development on the Admin side is currently in progress
                  (Complete as of Nov 2024). A simplified version of the
                  consultant-facing app is already live, allowing the company to
                  conduct business while the full platform is being built.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Although the project is ongoing, it’s already proving
                  successful and is used daily by the team.
                </p>
