                <p>
                  About 5 years ago, I started learning Chinese as a hobby. I
                  tried many of the learning apps and settled on two as having
                  the best features, Hello Chinese for vocabulary and grammar
                  while Du Chinese is my preferred reading app.
                </p>
                <br />

                <br />

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  As mentioned before, I used many Chinese learning apps over
                  the years. However, there were a few patterns I noticed that I
                  did not care for:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Most are targeted towards students</span>
                    - Most apps are designed around college students or students
                    living abroad. Meaning there is a lot of early content about
                    classes, school, dating, etc. For older working
                    professionals, the early learning phases can be a turn off.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Repetitive content</span> - Since all the
                    content is created upfront, unless it is updated often, a
                    high frequency user will memorize many of the answers making
                    it hard to determine if they actually understand the content
                    versus memorized it.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  To manage this global sales team, ABC Jewels needed a product
                  inventory solution that allows their consultants to quickly
                  find jewelry based on specific tastes of their clients. A
                  bonus goal would be that this solution would also be needed to
                  help consultants do personalized outreach.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Competitive Analysis:</h4>

                <p>
                  Since I have used so many apps, the competitive analysis was
                  technically already done in my head. I went back and reviewed
                  the ones I liked best and noted things that they did well or
                  had in common,
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Gamification</span> - One things that
                    almost all language learning apps do is gamify the learning
                    experience. Which makes sense because if it is not for a
                    class, many people find it difficult to stay motivated to
                    learn a language.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Playful Style</span> - To accompany the
                    gamification of learning, these apps are often designs to
                    look like mobile games. Bright colors, cute characters, and
                    rewarding animation were very common.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Guided Learning:</span>Because these apps
                    are designed to teach college aged users from absolute
                    beginners, the content is very simplified and often revolved
                    around topics relevant to them for much of the course
                    lengths.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br /><br />

                <h5 class="blog-subsection">Hello Chinese Screenshots</h5>
                <p>
                  <img
                    src="assets/img/blog/details/case_study_2/hello-chinese.png"
                    alt="Hello Chinese app"
                  />
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h5 class="blog-subsection">Du Chinese Screenshots</h5>
                <p>
                  <img
                    src="assets/img/blog/details/case_study_2/du-chinese.png"
                    alt="Du Chinese Reading App"
                  />
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Client is also a persona, but they are outside the scope
                  of this case study.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <h4>AI UX Considerations:</h4>
                <p>
                  AI is moving much faster than designers can keep up. Having
                  used AI to assist me with Mandarin has given me a lot of
                  exposure to potential UX benefits as well as problems. I’m
                  using ChatGPT 4.0 for this applications so any mention of AI
                  is referring to that AI specifically.
                </p>

                <table>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Benefits</th>

                    <td>Customized Content</td>
                    <td>
                      Because AI can generate content on the fly, there’s no
                      need to create a large amount of it and store it in a
                      database. The user can tell the AI what topics they want
                      to learn with.

                      In learning apps, they generally tell you right or wrong.
                      AI can give you more explanation and provide guidance
                      specific to you.

                    <td>
                      The user will never get to the point where they have
                      learned all of the content, because it is generated on the
                      fly per user.

                  <tr>
                    <td>Hallucinations</td>
                    <td>
                      Hallucinations are when the AI is confidently wrong about
                      something. It may make up information if it doesn’t know
                      the answer. The big problem with this when you are
                      learning is that you might not even realize it is not the
                      right answer.

                    <td>Irrelevant content</td>
                    <td>
                      It doesn’t take much for the user's inputs to cause the AI
                      go off-topic. This can be controlled, but requires extra
                      effort.

                    <td>
                      ChatGPT is known to sometimes just be down. They have
                      millions of users everyday so there is just going to be
                      connectivity problems from time to time.

                      specific information, and it will only reference that
                      information in its responses.

                      Giving the user free rein on text inputs to your AI can be
                      a problem. Of course, you can train your AI to avoid this,
                      but users are clever, and it would require a lot of work
                      and tesitng to esnure that the AI does not stray off-
                      topic. To solve this, when possible the AI will generate
                      options for answers and the user selects from those rather
                      than using the text input. This reduced interaction should
                      prevent off-topic conversation.

                      generated when they pick their topics of interest in the
                      user flow. This will be shown below.

                <h4>Technical Discovery:</h4>
                <p>
                  The idea for the app came to me when I started using ChatGPT
                  to help me study. As mentioned before, the materials in the
                  apps I use was pre-generated and since I have been using the
                  apps for years, I could answer some questions without even
                  looking at it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This inspired me to instruct ChatGPT to quiz me. Over time, I
                  fine-tuned how I wanted to be tested based on my preferred
                  style of learning. I even instructed the AI to keep track of
                  my performance and recommend topics of study.
                </p>

                <p>
                  What was missing was a nice UI to render this learning
                  experience. ChatGPTs UI is obviously designed to be
                  conversational so I began building a proof of concept to
                  simulate how XiongMao would use ChatGPT to generate
                  personalized and non-repeating content. That proof of concept
                  is a work in progress and can be found here…
                </p>

                <br /><br />

                <h4>UX + UI Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  Having a variety of test question types is a key part of
                  learning. If the same information is presented in different
                  ways, it becomes more like that the learning will understand.
                  (Include stats if possible). Much of the wireframing revolved
                  around experimenting with different question types for
                  different types of learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Visually, the UI for XiongMao needs to at least be of the same
                  style as other language learning apps if I intend to make it
                  public. So I adopted the colorful, playful style of other apps
                  and based it around the color of China’s flag.
