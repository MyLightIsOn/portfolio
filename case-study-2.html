                <p>
                  Language learning apps are a big business. Companies like
                  Duolingo have millions of daily users. Creating languange
                  learning apps also require huge investments in staff and
                  content creation. Content needs to be designed, updated, and
                  refreshed. AI has really changed the landscape of that
                  industry lowering the barrier of entry significantly.
                </p>
                <br />

                <br />

                <h4>Problem:</h4>

                <p>
                  I used many Chinese learning apps over the years. However,
                  there were a few patterns I noticed that I did not care for:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Most are targeted towards students</span>
                    - Most apps are designed around college students or students
                    living abroad. Meaning there is a lot of early content about
                    classes, school, dating, etc. For older working
                    professionals, the early learning phases can be a turn off.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Repetitive content</span> - Since all the
                    content is created upfront, unless it is updated often, a
                    high frequency user will memorize many of the answers making
                    it hard to determine if they actually understand the content
                    versus memorized it.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  I initially started using AI to support my learning to get
                  around these shortcomings, then it occured to me that I could
                  build an entire app around it to learn how to design and build
                  an AI product.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <h4>Competitive Analysis:</h4>

                <p>
                  Since I have used so many apps, the competitive analysis was
                  technically already done in my head. I went back and reviewed
                  the ones I liked best and noted things that they did well or
                  had in common.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Gamification</span> - One things that
                    almost all language learning apps do is gamify the learning
                    experience. Which makes sense because if it is not for a
                    class, many people find it difficult to stay motivated to
                    learn a language.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Playful Style</span> - To accompany the
                    gamification of learning, these apps are often designs to
                    look like mobile games. Bright colors, cute characters, and
                    rewarding animation were very common.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Guided Learning</span> - Because these
                    apps are designed to teach college aged users from absolute
                    beginners, the content is very simplified and often revolved
                    around topics relevant to them for much of the course
                    lengths.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>AI UX Considerations:</h4>
                <p>
                  AI is moving much faster than designers can keep up. Having
                  used AI to assist me with Mandarin has given me a lot of
                  exposure to potential UX benefits as well as problems. I’m
                  using ChatGPT 4.0 for this applications so any mention of AI
                  is referring to that AI specifically.
                </p>

                <table class="detail-table">
                  <tr>
                    <th>Advantages</th>
                    <th>Details</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Customized Content</td>
                    <td>
                      Because AI can generate content on the fly, there’s no
                      need to create a large amount of it and store it in a
                      database. The user can tell the AI what topics they want
                      to learn with.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>More Detailed Feedback</td>
                    <td>
                      In learning apps, they generally tell you right or wrong.
                      AI can give you more explanation and provide guidance
                      specific to you.

                    <td>Less Repeated Content</td>
                    <td>
                      The user will never get to the point where they have
                      learned all the content, because it is generated on the
                      fly per user.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </table>

                <table class="detail-table">

                    <td>Hallucinations</td>
                    <td>
                      Hallucinations are when the AI is confidently wrong about
                      something. It may make up information if it doesn’t know
                      the answer. The big problem with this when you are
                      learning is that you might not even realize it is not the
                      right answer.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Irrelevant content</td>
                    <td>
                      It doesn’t take much for the user's inputs to cause the AI
                      go off-topic. This can be controlled, but requires extra
                      effort.

                      ChatGPT is known to sometimes just be down. They have
                      millions of users everyday so there is just going to be
                      connectivity problems from time to time.

                <p>
                  Addessing these disadvantages is a first step, however
                  usability testing on the outputs of AI will be an essential
                  step in ensuring they perform as expected.

                      Using the OpenAI Assistant API may solve this. It is
                      essentially a ChatGPT that you can train on specific
                      information, It will only reference that information. By
                      giving the AI content that I have previewed, then it
                      should prevent hallucinations.

                      Giving the user free rein on text inputs to your AI can be
                      a problem. Of course, you can train your AI to avoid this,
                      but users are clever and I won’t want to spend all that
                      time trying to prevent topic conversation. To solve this,
                      the AI will generate the possible answers and the user
                      selects from them. This reduced interaction should prevent
                      off-topic conversation.

                      If ChatGPT is down, the user would not be able to do their
                      lessons. To solve this, all the users content will be
                      generated when they pick their topics of interest in the
                      user flow. This will be shown below.

                <h4>Proof of Concept:</h4>

                <p>
                  I've put together a proof of concept with these two goals in
                  mind:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Technical Discovery</span> - I find it
                    easier for me to design experiences if I at least have some
                    technical understanding of what is actually possible.
                    Building a proof of concept will allow me to find the edges
                    of what can and can not happen.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="bold">Usability Testing</span> - As I mentioned
                    before, testing the output of AI is critical since it can
                    essentially output anything if it believes it is correct.
                    Heavy usability testing can help companies avoid embarrasing
                    outputs.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  To create this proof of concept, I have uploaded
                  <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi"
                    target="_blank"
                    >HSK Lists</a
                  >
                  to the
                  <a
                    href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview"
                    target="_blank"
                  >
                    Open AI Assisstant</a
                  >
                  I created.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align: center">
                  <a href="https://language-app-poc.vercel.app/" target="_blank"
                    >The proof of concept can be found HERE</a
                  >
                </p>

                <p>
                  Keep in mind that I have not done any design or development to
                  improve the experience, so it's kind of rough. However, it
                  accomplishes the technical discovery goal (Hey, I got it
                  working) and will allow me to do usability tesitng.
                </p>

                <h4>User Flow:</h4>

                <p>
                  In the Chinese learning communities that I follow, there was a
                  lot of interest in having an app like this available so I
                  designed a user flow that would work for users other than
                  myself.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Creating a skill level assessment to get started was a highly
                  requested feature, so I have accounted for that in my design.
                </p>

                <h4>Skills Assessment:</h4>

                <p>
                  Learning a langauge involves several different types of
                  learnng, Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. One
                  feature that I would like to see the ability to know which
                  areas you need to work on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My Chinese reading is much better than my listening and being
                  able to show progress in these inidividually would be
                  extremely helplful.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I created question type samples showing how to assess these
                  areas of learning.
                </p>

                <figure>

                  </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h4>UI Design:</h4>

                <p>
                  Lastly, I put together some UI designs in Figma that keep with
                  the spirit of other language learning apps.
                </p>

                <h4>Conclusion:</h4>

                <p>
                  I'm currently doing usabilitly tesitng with the proof of
                  concept and training the AI to generate questions and answers
                  without disrupting the experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Just 5 years ago, it would take millions in investment and an
                  army of content creators to build a langauge app like this,
                  however with advances in AI, the logistics barrier has been
                  removed. Now it's all about creating the best learning
                  experience.
